# Programming Portfolio

This programming portfolio contains a small sampling of projects that I've created using various languages and frameworks, including this very portfolio, which was created entirely with Ember.js.

## Projects

The Projects page contains a gallery of the various sample projects along with some basic information about them. Clicking on the project tile will take you to either the GitHub Pages site running it if it is a web app or the GitHub repo page for the project to learn more about it.

## About

The About page contains a more complete overview of my past experience, skills and education. I've also included the gallery of sample projects in an alternate, compact view with tags indicating the various skills involved in their creation.
